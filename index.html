							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<p class="major">My love for technology began in elementary school. Whether I was taking AR tests or playing computer games, my teachers often noticed that I would wander into the system-level files on school computers—not to cause trouble, but because I was endlessly curious about what was hidden beneath the surface. That curiosity never left me. Over time, it grew into a passion for understanding how technology works, how it can be improved, and how it can be applied to solve real problems.

For me, technology isn’t just about using tools—it’s about exploring, experimenting, and creating new possibilities.</p>

							<h2>Video Upload & Management Platform</h2>
							<p>When I set out to build this project, my goal was to create a simple yet powerful web application for uploading and managing video content. I wanted to design a solution from the ground up that balanced ease of use with strong backend performance.

I built the application using an empty ASP.NET Framework project for server-side logic, FFMPEG for video compression, and HTTPCookie for session tracking, with MySQL managing video metadata storage and retrieval. On the frontend, I combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a responsive, intuitive interface that makes video uploading fast and seamless.

The result is a fully functional system that bridges backend processing with frontend usability. This project not only demonstrates my ability to integrate diverse technologies but also reflects my development philosophy: begin with the user experience, then build a solid technical foundation to support it.

							<h2>Data Modeling</h2>
							<p>I have strong experience in database modeling, specializing in relational databases with a focus on MySQL. I design efficient, normalized schemas that ensure data integrity, reduce redundancy, and optimize performance. My expertise includes creating ERD diagrams, defining relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many), and implementing constraints to enforce business rules. I’m skilled at translating complex business requirements into structured, scalable database architectures that support both backend logic and application workflows.</p>

							<h2>Programming Knowledge</h2>
							<p>I am proficient in a wide array of programming languages, including Java, C#, PHP, UNIX shell scripting, MySQL, AWS suites, and several others. This diverse skill set has enabled me to work across multiple development environments, from backend server logic to database management and frontend integration.  This versatility allows me to approach problems creatively and integrate technologies in ways that maximize performance and usability.</p>
