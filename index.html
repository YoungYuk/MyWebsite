							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<p class="major">My love for technology started in elementary school, when I couldn’t resist taking apart gadgets just to see how they worked. I was the kid who poked around in system-level files on school computers; not to cause trouble, but because I was endlessly curious about what was hidden beneath the surface.

That curiosity never left me. Over the years, it grew into a passion for learning how technology works, how it can be improved, and how it can be used to solve real problems. For me, tech isn’t just about using tools, it’s about exploring, experimenting, and building new possibilities.</p>

							<h2>Video Upload & Management Platform</h2>
							<p>When I set out to build this project, my goal was to create a simple yet powerful way for users to upload and manage video content through a web application. Many platforms make this process overly complicated or lack customization, so I wanted to design a solution from the ground up that balanced usability with solid backend performance.
I developed the application using C# and ASP.NET to handle server-side logic, while MySQL served as the database for storing and retrieving video metadata. On the frontend, I combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive, intuitive interface that makes uploading videos fast and straightforward.

The result is a fully functional system that bridges the gap between backend processing and frontend usability. This project not only highlights my ability to integrate multiple technologies but also reflects my approach to solving real-world problems: start with the user experience, then build the technical foundation to support it.

							<h2>Data Modeling</h2>
							<p>I have strong experience in database modeling, specializing in relational databases with a focus on MySQL. I design efficient, normalized schemas that ensure data integrity, reduce redundancy, and optimize performance. My expertise includes creating ERD diagrams, defining relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many), and implementing constraints to enforce business rules. I’m skilled at translating complex business requirements into structured, scalable database architectures that support both backend logic and application workflows.</p>

							<h2>Programming Knowledge</h2>
							<p>I am proficient in a wide array of programming languages, including Java, C#, PHP, UNIX shell scripting, MySQL, AWS suites, and several others. This diverse skill set has enabled me to work across multiple development environments, from backend server logic to database management and frontend integration.  This versatility allows me to approach problems creatively and integrate technologies in ways that maximize performance and usability.</p>
